# froggy-mem

1. Strategy
Build a fun and challenging memory game that will engage the player.  The game theme will be a lilly pond with different coloured frogs on it.    
2. Scope
The frogs will ribbet in a random order and the player will have to play back the same order by clicking on the frogs.  Each level will last for a set amount of time, possibly 30 secs. 
 The game will get harder by the addition of more frogs as the levels progress. The player will have 3 lives which will decrement as player makes mistake, when they run out of lives the game will be over.  Possibly reset the player lives at the start of each level.  There will also be a scoring system that will increase based on the length of the sequence that the player succefully remembers.  When the game is over the player's score will be added to the high score table.
